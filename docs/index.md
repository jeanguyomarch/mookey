Welcome to `mookey`'s documentation. The following sections highlight
different aspects to better understand the essence of this project.

# Motivations

`mookey` exists because it seems there is a little gap in password management
and especially in **password mobility**, that is when you want to share secrets
(e.g. passwords) between computers without relying on network solutions.

# Threat Model

`mookey` has a well-specified threat model. Read it carefully to understand
whether this suits your needs (security, privacy, reliability requirements)
or not.

# Building a mookey

Once you are familiar with its [motivations][1] and [threat model][2],
and if `mookey` suits your needs, you can try creating one.
